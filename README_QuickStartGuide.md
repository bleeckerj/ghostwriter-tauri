# Ghostwriter Quick Start Guide (macOS)

Welcome to Ghostwriter, your AI-powered writing companion on macOS. Ghostwriter helps you brainstorm, draft, and refine text by tapping into a customizable knowledge base (“Canon”) and guided “Vibe Mode.” This guide will get you up and running in minutes—no coding required.

## 1. Launching Ghostwriter

- Download and unzip the Ghostwriter macOS app bundle.
- Open Ghostwriter.app from your Applications folder.
- On first launch, you may be prompted to authorize permissions—click Allow.

That’s it! You’re now ready to start writing with AI assistance.

## 2. Core Concepts

### Canon

Your Canon is a collection of reference documents (PDFs, text files) that Ghostwriter can draw on to give contextually relevant suggestions. Build your Canon once, then Ghostwriter will use it whenever you ask for help.

### Vibe Mode

Vibe Mode lets you steer the tone or style of AI suggestions. For example, a formal tone, a playful tone, or a documentary vibe. Turn it on when you want the AI to adopt a specific “voice.”

## 3. Creating & Managing Your Canon

- Click File → Add to Canon (or drag-and-drop files into the Canon panel).
- Give your Canon a memorable name (e.g., “Marketing Guides”).
- Ghostwriter will automatically index the content—this may take a few seconds.
- Your Canon is now available for reference in all streaming completions.

## 4. Writing with Ghost Suggestions

- Begin typing in the main editor window.
- Press STRM (Streaming) button to toggle streaming suggestions on/off:
  - Off (default): No real-time suggestions.
  - On (green): Live suggestions stream as you type.
  - Overline (dark green + overline): Turn on “RAG” mode—incorporates your Canon into suggestions.
- When streaming is on, Ghostwriter will display a faint “ghost text” suggestion.
- Accept suggestion: Press Tab.
- Cycle suggestions: Hold Shift and press ↓ or ↑ to browse a buffered list.
- If you reach the end of the buffer, Ghostwriter will automatically fetch more suggestions.

## 5. Using Vibe Mode

- Click the Vibe button to enable Vibe Mode (it highlights when on).
- The AI will adopt the style you set in Preferences (e.g., “Journalistic,” “Playful”).
- Click Vibe again to turn it off and return to neutral mode.

## 6. Buttons & Controls

| Button / Control       | What It Does                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| STRM                  | Toggles real-time streaming suggestions. Three states: Off → On → RAG mode. |
| Vibe                  | Toggles AI tone mode on/off based on your preset style. |
| Shift + ↓ / Shift + ↑ | Cycle forward/back through available suggestions.   |
| Tab                   | Accept the current ghost suggestion and insert it into your text. |
| Preferences (⚙️)      | Open the settings panel to adjust prompts, limits, API keys, etc. |
| Refresh Models        | Reload available AI models for your chosen provider. |
| Add to Canon          | Import new reference documents into your Canon.      |

## 7. Tips & Tricks

- Keep your Canon focused: A smaller, well-curated set of documents yields more relevant suggestions.
- Adjust context length: In Preferences, you can control how much of your recent text the AI uses as context (up to 300 words by default).
- Vibe presets: Experiment with different Vibe Modes—each can dramatically change the tone of your suggestions.
