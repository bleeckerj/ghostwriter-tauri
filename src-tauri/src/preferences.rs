Write the start of a song in the style of a randomly chosen genre (e.g., pop, rock, country, psychedelic rock). The song should be about a theme or emotion, with a narrative arc that builds from an introduction to a climax. Incorporate the following elements into your lyrics:

- A catchy chorus with a clear and repetitive melody
- Verse 1: Introduce the protagonist and their situation
- Chorus: Summarize the main theme of the song in a short, memorable phrase
- Verse 2: Develop the story and characters through descriptive language
- Bridge: Provide an unexpected twist or contrast to the song's progression
- Outro: Resolve the narrative while maintaining emotional resonance

**Specific Requirements:**

1. Include at least two metaphors or similes within your lyrics.
2. Utilize a consistent rhyme scheme throughout the song, but avoid overly complex patterns.
3. Incorporate a conversational tone in the dialogue between characters (if applicable).
4. Use an active voice and descriptive adjectives to create vivid imagery.
5. Ensure the song's pacing is well-balanced, with a clear build-up and release.

**Key Word Constraints:**

1. Limit your use of the words 'love,' 'heart,' and 'pain' as individual elements within your lyrics.
2. Avoid using more than three instances of the word 'you' in a single line or verse.
3. Refrain from utilizing any clichéd phrases or lines that have become overly popular.

**Style Guidelines:**

1. Aim for an average sentence length of 15-20 words per line.
2. Use a mix of short and long sentences to create dynamic rhythm and flow.
3. Emphasize the emotional core of the song, but avoid heavy-handedness in conveying themes or messages",

Start a story set in a dystopian near-future where corporations and governments wield significant power. The narrative should revolve around [protagonist/plot], with a focus on themes of:

- Surveillance and control
- Identity and self-discovery
- Rebellion against oppressive regimes

2. Include cutting-edge technology, like advanced artificial intelligence, biometric implants, or cybernetic enhancements.
3. Explore the tension between those who control the system (e.g., megacorporations) and those who seek to challenge it (e.g., revolutionaries, hackers).
4. Use vivid descriptions of neon-lit cityscapes, dingy nightclubs, and cramped virtual reality chambers.

**Cyberpunk Clichés to Avoid:**

1. Steer clear of overly simplistic 'good vs. evil' conflicts.
2. Don't rely on tired cyberpunk tropes (e.g., corrupt corporations, underground revolutionaries).
3. Be mindful of how you portray the protagonist's transformation or growth; avoid clichéd 'chosen one' narratives.

**Neuro-Psychological Insights:**

1. Incorporate psychological insights into your characters' backstories and motivations.
2. Explore the implications of prolonged virtual reality exposure on mental health and social connections.
3. Consider the effects of advanced biotechnology on human identity, relationships, and society as a whole.

**Key Word Constraints:**

1. Limit your use of the words 'rebellion,' 'uprise,' or 'protest' within 500 characters across the entire story.
2. Avoid using more than two instances of the phrase 'the system' in a single scene.
3. Refrain from utilizing any overly convenient plot devices, like instant access to advanced hacking tools.
