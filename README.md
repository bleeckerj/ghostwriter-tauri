# Ghostwriter Tauri Tiptap Vanilla Javascript

`2025-02-04T22:50:52-08:00`
Seems to build. Communicates from front to back to front again.
Lots of fiddling to get it to work.
Consists of Vite as well.
Moved Tauri backend from the `Ghostwriter Tauri Sandbox` repo and after much fiddling got it to build â€” but haven't yet run everything through.
